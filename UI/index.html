      <h2><a href="answer.html">Flask modal authentication</h2></a>
      <h5>Asked:, Sep 2, 2017</h5>

        <p>I want to create a flask authentication, but i don't want to set the register and login to other pages, but on the same page. The links to register/login are on a navbar that appears on all the pages of the site, and, when i click on one of them, i want a modal to open and let you register/login from there, not to switch to another page. How can i do that?

      <h2><a href="answer.html">I want to have excel reference a shape with an active label over it with a mouseover event to pop up a gif</h2></a>

      <h5>Asked:, Jan 25, 2018</h5>

        <p>So, I'm making a flowchart and for each shape/object in the flowchart I will use an active label, set it to transparent and remove all of the captions so for all intents and purposes, it will be a blank label over the shape/object. When I open the label in vba, it will show up as a click event, which I then change to a mouse over event. The problem I have is that I want that mouseover event to use a gif (best scenario) or a picture (worst scenario) from a different drive in my computer.For instance, say I have a folder called "Flow Chart." Inside this folder I have another folder called "Gifs" and the excel file called FlowChartGifs.xlsm. The excel file would then have the mouseover properties from the labels over the shapes/objects to call specific gifs from the other folder. I don't know if it matters but it would be a network folder.
